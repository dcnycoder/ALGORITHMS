// A child is running up a staircase with n steps and can
// hop either 1 step, 2 steps or 3 steps at a time, 
// implement a method to count how many possible ways
// the child can run up the stairs

// You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.

// Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

// Example 1:

// Input: n = 2
// Output: 2
// Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
// 1. 1 step + 1 step
// 2. 2 steps
// Example 2:

// Input: n = 3
// Output: 3
// Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
// 1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
// 2. 1 step + 2 steps
// 3. 2 steps + 1 step
